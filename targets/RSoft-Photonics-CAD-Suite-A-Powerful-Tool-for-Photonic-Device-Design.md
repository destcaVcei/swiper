# RSoft Photonics CAD Suite: A Powerful Tool for Photonic Device Design
 
RSoft Photonics CAD Suite is a software package that allows researchers and engineers to create, simulate, and optimize photonic devices and circuits. It consists of several modules that use different numerical methods to solve various problems in photonics, such as waveguide propagation, diffractive optics, photonic crystals, and semiconductor lasers. RSoft Photonics CAD Suite is developed by Synopsys, a leading provider of photonic solutions[^6^] [^7^] [^8^].

In this article, we will introduce some of the main features and benefits of RSoft Photonics CAD Suite, and show how it can help you design and analyze your photonic devices and systems.
 
## RSoft CAD Environment: The Core Program
 
The RSoft CAD Environment is the core program of the RSoft Photonic Device Tools, and acts as a control program for RSoft's passive device modules[^6^]. It allows you to create systems for the design of waveguide devices, optical circuits, and other photonic devices. It also defines the important input required by these modules: the material properties and structural geometry of the device to be studied.
 
The RSoft CAD Environment has a highly flexible design environment that allows virtually any geometry to be created. You can select from a toolbar of fundamental objects such as straight, tapered, and curved components, lenses, and polygons, and graphically add them to the circuit using the mouse. You can also create customized components using mathematical equations or data files. You can specify component positions directly, either absolutely or through relative offsets with respect to any other component. You can also select and modify one or several components at any time.
 
Each individual component can have its own set of properties that can be accessed with a right click of the mouse. Parameters include shape information and optical properties such as refractive index profile type and value. You can also use arithmetic expressions involving user-defined variables to specify each parameter of a component, rather than simply being a constant number. This allows you to easily modify an entire design by changing the value of a single variable without having to edit multiple parts of the structure.
 
The RSoft CAD Environment also supports 3D editing options that allow you to view the structure along the X, Y, and Z axis. You can also use a multi-pane mode where the X, Y, Z, and rotatable 3D views are shown at once. Additionally, you can use hierarchical layout to build arbitrarily complicated structures from smaller components.
 
## RSoft Passive Device Modules: A Wide Range of Simulators
 
RSoft Photonic Device Tools include several passive device modules that use different simulation algorithms to study various aspects of photonic devices[^7^]. These modules are integrated with the RSoft CAD Environment and can be easily accessed from its interface. The passive device modules are:
 
- FullWAVE: A highly sophisticated simulation tool based on the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method for studying the propagation of light in a wide variety of photonic structures.
- BeamPROP: An industry-leading design tool based on the Beam Propagation Method (BPM) for the design and simulation of integrated and fiber-optic waveguide devices and circuits.
- DiffractMOD: A design and simulation tool for diffractive optical structures such as diffractive optical elements, subwavelength periodic structures, and photonic bandgap crystals.
- BandSOLVE: A design tool to automate and simplify the modeling and calculation of photonic band structures for all photonic crystal devices.
- FemSIM: A generalized mode solver based on the Finite Element Method (FEM) that can calculate any number of transverse or cavity modes of an arbitrary structure on a non-uniform mesh.
- GratingMOD: A general design tool for analyzing and synthesizing complicated grating profiles in optical fibers and integrated waveguide circuits for a wide variety of photonic applications.
- ModePROP: An Eigenmode Expansion (EME) propagation tool that accounts for both forward and backward propagation and radiation modes.
- MetaOptic Designer: A tool that automatically generates metalenses and metasurfaces for optimal design performance.

Each module has its own set of features and capabilities that allow you to perform various tasks such as calculating field distributions, transmission spectra, reflection
